= Installation 

  # gem install binder

= Use

binder allows you to change the closure in which a proc is executed. This is helpful for anyone developing their own domain specific language in ruby. For more information about proc binding, check out this post I wrote which in turn inspired me to write this gem: http://moonmaster9000.tumblr.com/post/398991873/creating-cleaner-apis


== Proc#bind_to

The #bind_to method on a proc instance allows you to change the closure in which the proc is run:
  
  # irb
  >> require 'binder'
    ==> true
    
  >> def speak
  >>   "why should i?"
  >> end
    ==> nil

  >> class Dog
  >>   def speak
  >>       "ruff!"
  >>     end
  >> end
    ==> nil

  >> command = proc { speak }
    ==> #<Proc:0x012c6a04@(irb):28>

  >> command.call
    ==> "why should i?"  

  >> command.bind_to(Dog.new).call
    ==> "ruff!"
  

== Object##bind

binder also provides the "#bind" object class method to DRY up your DSL instance methods: 

  >> class Dog
  >>   bind :do_trick, :self # binds to the instance of Dog
  >>     
  >>   def speak
  >>     "ruff!"
  >>   end
  >> end
    ==> nil
  
  >> Dog.new.do_trick { speak }
    ==> "ruff!"
    
  >> class Cat
  >>   bind :do_trick, :class # binds to Cat, not an instance of Cat
  >>   
  >>   class << self
  >>     def speak
  >>       "screw you"
  >>     end
  >>   end
  >>   
  >>   def speak
  >>     "bugger off"
  >>   end
  >> end
    ==> nil
    
  >> Cat.new.do_trick { speak }
    ==> "screw you"
  
  >> class Kitten
  >>   bind :do_trick, :mother # binds to @mother instance variable
  >>   
  >>   def initialize(mom)
  >>     @mother = mom
  >>   end
  >> end 
    ==> nil
  
  >> Kitten.new(Cat).do_trick { speak }
    ==> "screw you"
  
  >> Kitten.new(Cat.new).do_trick { speak }
    ==> "bugger off"
  
  >> Kitten.new(Dog.new).do_trick { speak }
    ==> "ruff!"
  
== Object##bind_class_method
  
Whereas the Object##bind method created instance methods, Object##bind_class_method creates class methods:

  >> class Cat
  >>   bind :do_trick, :class # binds to Cat class, not an instance of Cat
  >> 
  >>   class << self
  >>     def speak
  >>       "screw you"
  >>     end
  >>   end
  >>   
  >>   def speak
  >>     "bugger off"
  >>   end
  >> end
    ==> nil
  
  >> class Lion
  >>   bind_class_method :tame, :self # binds to Lion, since "self" will be evaluated in the context
  >>                                  # of a class method
  >>   bind_class_method :do_trick, :child # binds to value returned by method "child"
  >>   class << self
  >>     def down_kitty
  >>       "meow"
  >>     end
  >>     
  >>     def child
  >>       @child ||= Cat
  >>     end
  >>   end
  >> end
    ==> nil
     
  >> Lion.tame { down_kitty }
    ==> "meow"
    
  >> Lion.do_trick { speak }
    ==> "screw you"
